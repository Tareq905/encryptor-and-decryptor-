# Encryptor/Decryptor tool using python

## Overview

Shadow is a simple **text-based encryption and decryption tool** built with Python's Tkinter GUI. It allows users to securely encode messages into Base64 and decode them back using a password.

This project is ideal for learning **Python GUI development**, basic **encryption techniques**, and **user input handling**.

## Features

* Encrypt text input into Base64 format.
* Decrypt Base64-encoded text back to original message.
* Password-protected access (default password: `4321`).
* Reset button to clear input and password.
* User-friendly Tkinter interface.
* Customizable GUI with color-coded buttons and layout.

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install Tkinter (if not included in your Python distribution).

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python shadow_encryptor.py
```

2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter the password (default is `4321`).
4. Click `Encrypt` or `Decrypt`.
5. Use `Reset` to clear input fields.

## Notes

* This tool uses **Base64 encoding**, which is **not a secure encryption method for real-world applications**. It is intended for educational purposes.
* The GUI icon can be customized by replacing `logo.png` in the project directory.
